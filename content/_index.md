## What is an /top4 page?

A **/top4** page is a personal webpage where you can share your definitive ranked list of your top 3 favorites and an honorable mention. In a specific topic, such as movies, albums, snacks, games, or anything else you feel strongly about. 

Inspired by the fun, opinionated style of ranking things in fours, it allows you to express your tastes clearly and concisely while inviting discussion and debate. 

You can add a **/top4** page to your personal website as a lightweight and engaging way to share more about yourself beyond the usual /about or /now pages.

## Add or remove your /top4 page?

If you have an account on GitHub, please [follow the steps](https://github.com/peterspath/topfour.net) in the readme. If not, or if you run into any issues, feel free to [reach out](mailto:hi@topfour.net) to me.

If for any reason you wish to remove your **/top4** page from the directory, you can follow the [same steps](https://github.com/peterspath/topfour.net) from the readme, but instead of *adding* a new line to data file, *delete* your respective line from the data file.

Only Pull Requests made by the same GitHub user that originally *added* the line to the data file will be merged, i.e. please do not request deletions on behalf of someone else.
