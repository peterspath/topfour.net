# Top Four

### 1. Go to the data file

[Go to data file...](https://github.com/peterspath/topfour.net/blob/main/data/data.json)


### 2. Edit file

Click on the edit (pencil) button. GitHub will prompt you to fork the repository under your own user so that a Pull Request can be made.

[Learn more about Pull Requests.](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)


### 3. Add your /top4 page

Add the following to the data file, replacing the values with your own: 

```
{ "name": "Example", "url": "https://example.com/top4/", "emoji": "🍕", "category": "Pizza", "number1": "Hawaii", "number2": "Pepperoni", "number3": "Brooklyn", "number4": "Chicago" },
```

Do not forget the trailing comma. Unless you are the last entry. It does not matter where you add your addition in the file. It will be sorted alphabetically,

### 4. Commit file

Commit the file, and if you could be so kind, set the Commit Message to something that helps me understand what your commit is doing.

Example: "added: Example to the directory"

### 5. Create Pull Request

GitHub will then prompt you to create a Pull Request against the original repository. Do so and you are all set!

### 6. Review

Submissions will be reviewed as quickly as possible, and when your Pull Request is merged, your website will appear in the directory above!

### 7. Link back

It would be awesome if you link back to this website from your **/top4** page. This way your readers can discover Top 4's from other people.
